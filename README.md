# connect_six
Connect six is a k in a row family of games in which the player needs to place six stones in a row or column or diagonal to win the game. As a player can place two stones at a time, the solution space of the very large so that a normal game search algorithm like a Minimax algrorthm to search for solutions is not possible in a micro controller architecture like in a Microchip PIC 18F452 due to the low processing power+low memory. Try to implement a good algorithm is a tedious task here as the AI should be fair enough competitive to a user or a player who plays against it. In this circumstances, we have developed an AI which is fairly competitive enough to compete against a human player with the implementation of modified algorithms to suit the scarce resources in the micro controller. The AI can give a move within 10 seconds with a 40Mhz clock.
